In some environments (for example, KDE 3), gvim is unable to properly maximize or unmaximize itself, due to interactions with window managers or other issues.

Maxivim bypasses window managers, allowing you to maximize gvim vertically, horizontally, or both, and restore it from having maximized it.

Maxivim also allows you to set the initial size of your gvim windows by setting environment variables ($GVIM_LINES and $GVIM_COLUMNS).

(This used to work with Vim 6, but I've only recently tested on Vim 7).
